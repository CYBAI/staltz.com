title: Big Tweets
---
<br />
<p>
The following resources are short blog posts. I call them "big tweets" because they are too large for a tweet, but too small to be considered blog posts. They are usually straight-to-the-point and just communicate a quick tip related to programming.

{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% if post.tags contains 'bigtweet' %}
  <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> ({{ post.date | date: "%Y-%B" }})<br />
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
